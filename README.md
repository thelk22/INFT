# Introduction to Financial Technology (INFT)

This repo contains various work completed in the INFT module. 

## Coursework

The coursework task was to analyse an algorithmic trading model called Parametrised-Response Stochastic Hill-Climber (PRSH), using the [Bristol Stock Exchange](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange). 

My submission for this can be found in the 'Coursework' folder. 

## Continuous Assessments

There were several continuous assessments throughout the module. Work for these can be found in the various 'CA' folders.
